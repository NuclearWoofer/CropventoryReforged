//This website will allow farmers to keep track of their inventory of crops for possible sale to partnered organizations such as Government Assistance programs and smaller businesses who choose to partner with Cropventory. The website wonâ€™t host a transaction system, it will just allow the farmer to see what their options are in terms of partnerships with local businesses and organizations. From there, the farmer will have to work with them to see what fits with them.

//This is personal for me as I had worked with farmers on all scales of class and color, some have a fair time selling and some do not. Being able to have a fair ground to make sales and maybe even encourage unique crops to grow in the area. This will also open up local consumers to shop local and support small businesses.
